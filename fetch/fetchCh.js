    // The Fetch API is used to make a network request to the specified URL.
    // The `fetch` function returns a promise that resolves to the response of the request.
    // The `url` parameter is the URL from which data is being fetched.
    // The `fetch` function is called with the URL as an argument.
    // The `response` variable holds the response object returned by the fetch call.
    // The `response` object contains information about the response, including the status code, headers, and body.

    // The `getReader` method is called on the response body stream to create a reader object.

    // The `read` method is called on the reader object to read a chunk of data from the stream.
    // The `read` method returns a promise that resolves to an object with two properties: `done` and `value`.
    // The `done` property indicates whether the stream has been fully read.
    // The `value` property contains the chunk of data read from the stream.
